### Introduction to Docker
- **Purpose**: To learn about Docker and its importance for data engineers.
- **What to cover**:
- Why Docker is necessary for data engineering.
- Running PostgreSQL in Docker for SQL practice.
- Utilizing the New York taxi rides dataset throughout the course.

### Overview of Docker
- **Definition**: Docker delivers software in packages called "containers," which are isolated from one another.
- **Isolation**: Important for running data pipelines without affecting the host machine.

### Data Pipelines
- **Definition**: A process/service that takes in data, processes it, and produces output data.
- **Components**:
- **Input Data**: E.g., CSV files.
- **Output Data**: E.g., tables in PostgreSQL.
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Pipelines can have several sources and destinations.

### Docker for Data Pipelines
- **Running Scripts**: A data pipeline script that transforms input data into output using specific dependencies (e.g., Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL).
- **Containers**: Multiple containers can run on a host machine without conflicts.

### Benefits of Using Docker
1. **Isolation**: Each container operates independently.
2. **Reproducibility**: Docker images ensure the same environment is maintained across different platforms (e.g., local, cloud).
3. **Local Experiments and Testing**: Docker allows for easy setup of test environments.
4. **Integration Tests**: Docker helps in validating data pipelines via integration tests.
5. **Support for CI/CD**: Docker facilitates continuous integration and delivery, although this topic is outside the course scope.

### Setting Up Docker
- **Testing Docker**:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

- **Running an Ubuntu Container**:
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

- **Installing Python and Pandas**:
```bash
docker run -it python:3.9
# Inside the Python prompt:
pip install pandas
```

### Creating a Dockerfile
- **Creating a Dockerfile**: Define the base image and the necessary commands to set up the environment.
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
RUN pip install pandas
ENTRYPOINT ["bash"]
```

### Building and Running a Docker Image
- **Build an Image from Dockerfile**:
```bash
docker build -t my_image_name .
```

- **Running the Built Image**:
```bash
docker run my_image_name
```


The `-it` and `-t` flags are options used with the `docker run` command to control the behavior of Docker containers. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of these flags and other commonly used options:

### Explanation of `-it` and `-t`

1. **`-i` (Interactive)**:
- Keeps the standard input (stdin) open even if not attached. This allows you to interact with the container's shell or application.

2. **`-t` (TTY)**:
- Allocates a pseudo-terminal (TTY) for the container, which provides an interactive terminal interface. This is necessary for interactive applications that require a terminal.

3. **`-it` combination**:
- Using `-it` together combines both flags, allowing you to run a container interactively with a terminal. This is useful for debugging or when you want to execute commands inside the container directly.

### Other Common Docker Run Options

- **`--rm`**: Automatically removes the container when it exits, freeing up resources without leaving stopped containers.

- **`-d` (Detach)**: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background), freeing up the terminal.

- **`-p` (Publish)**: Maps a port on the host to a port in the container. For example, `-p 8080:80` maps port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host.

- **`--name <container_name>`**: Assigns a name to the container, making it easier to reference later.

- **`-e` (Environment Variable)**: Sets environment variables inside the container. For example, `-e MY_VAR=value`.

- **`-v` (Volume)**: Mounts a directory from the host into the container. For example, `-v /host/path:/container/path` shares data between the host and the container.

- **`--network`**: Connects the container to a specific network. For instance, `--network=my_network`.


### Conclusion
- The video emphasizes that Docker is vital for data engineers for isolation, reproducibility, and ease of experimentation.
- Future sessions will involve running PostgreSQL locally with Docker and utilizing the New York taxi rides dataset.
